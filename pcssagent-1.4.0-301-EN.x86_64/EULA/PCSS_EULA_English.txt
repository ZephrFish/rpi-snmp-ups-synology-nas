1.1	In consideration of You agreeing to abide by, and subject to Your compliance with, all of the terms and conditions contained in this EULA, Schneider Electric grants to You a non-exclusive non-transferable, royalty-free, limited, world-wide (except for Japan for which a separate license right to use the Software Product must be purchased from relevant Schneider Electric’s Affiliate), license right to use the Software Product described in the Documentation or in the About/Installer Box, related to said Software Product for the term identified therein and in accordance with the license model identified therein. Where You are an individual natural person, the Software Product may only be used for Your personal use. Where You are a corporation, company or other legal entity, the Software may only be used for the purposes of Your ordinary business. Use is restricted on the applicable number of nodes, by the particular named user(s), in the particular location(s), on the particular device(s) and/or on the particular system(s) for which You have been licensed such Software Product, as those number of nodes, location(s), device(s) and/or system(s) are identified in the Documentation or in the About/Installer Box. If the Documentation, or the About/Installer Box fail to state a duration/term of the license granted hereunder, such license shall continue for as long as the Software Product is not replaced by a new software product that Schneider Electric makes available to you and to which you confirm your agreement to use in accordance with the end-user license agreement then governing the use of said new software product (unless the licence granted hereunder a trial license, in which case the duration/term shall be deemed to be thirty (30) days of such delivery). The Software Product will be provided to You in object code (machine-readable) form only and under no circumstances is Schneider Electric obligated to disclose the source code of the Software Product to You, unless such obligation is required in accordance with Section 11. The Software Product (including the related Documentation) is licensed to You and not sold to You.
1.2	This EULA describes and governs Your right to install and use the Software Product. It is expressly agreed that the terms and conditions of this EULA apply to the exclusion of, and will prevail over and supersede, any other the terms and conditions, including contained in any purchase order or purchasing document issued or submitted by You, whether before or after the effective date of this EULA; and the terms and conditions of any purchase order or purchasing document issued by You are expressly rejected by Schneider Electric. 
1.3	Upon expiry of the trial period or upon expiry of the limited period of time for which the license was granted to You, Your license to the Software Product will automatically and immediately revoke and terminate, unless a further license is obtained from Schneider Electric. Consequently, the Software Product might automatically be de-installed and/or rendered unusable (with or without prior warning).
1.4	You acknowledge that if You need to activate the Software Product through the use of internet or telephone, toll and/or internet charges may apply and will be at Your cost.
1.5	If technological measures are designed/incorporated to prevent unlicensed or illegal use of the Software Product, You agree that Schneider Electric may use those measures and You agree to comply with any requirements regarding such technological measures.
